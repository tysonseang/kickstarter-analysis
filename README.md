# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project involves data manipulation, analysis, pivoting, and charting in Microsoft Excel. Various filters, conditional formatting, and advanced formulas were created to modify data prior to analysis. Data was then filtered and pivoted in order to drill down into relevant outputs for an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns in the *theater* category. Various pivot charts were created to visualize the performance of campaigns according to various attributes. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to support an up-and-coming playwright analyze data from the crowdfunding website [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) to help guide the launch of her first crowdfunding campaign. By analyzing previous campaigns in the *theater* category, one can better understand if there are specific factors that make a fundraising campaign successful. Successful, failed, and canceled campaigns were analyzed by month of launch date across multiple years and by outcome based on campaign funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

Analysis was conducted in Microsoft Excel on a provided Kickstarter dataset. The original dataset can be accessed [here](Original Kickstarter Dataset.xlsx)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not experience any significant challenges during the Excel analysis portion of this project. I have experience manipulating and analyzing Excel data through functions, filters, charts, and pivot tables. However, this was my first experience with GitHub, so I did encounter a few speed bumps as I delved into basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub README files.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Historically, theater campaigns are most likely to meet their funding goals when launched between May and July. Theater campaigns are least successful when launched during the final two months of the year. The final month of the year also sees the fewest total launches of theater campaigns.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns that launched with a goal of raising 45,000 or more were unlikely to meet their funding goals. Campaigns with the most conservative target (less than 1,000) met their goal more than 75% of the time.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Campaign creators are not tracked within this dataset. The success or failure of a project could be the result of the person launching and running the campaign. Location data is also limited to the country level. Additional analysis could be completed to determine the likelihood of success based on these additional datapoints. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Further analysis of theater campaign subcategories would help differentiate between the performance of campaigns with often widely ranging costs and goals. Theater campaigns within the *spaces* subcategory had a significantly higher average goal than those within the *plays* and *musicals* subcategories. Due to the large variance in average funding goals, I recommend continuing analysis at the subcategory level.
